	This is where we examine how configuration management works in .NET Core. Configuration values can come from
	multiple sources (aka <i>Configuration Providers</i>). They are all registered inside a single configuration
	object, which provides a single consolidated view of all keys and values in the underlying providers.
</p>
<p>
	When the same configuration setting appears in multiple providers, the provider that is registered last
	will be the one providing the final value. Built in providers include JSON, Environmental Variables,
	and console arguments.
</p>

<p>
	With many applications and environments, configuration management adds significant opearational
	overhead. In these cases, you can use a Spring Cloud Config Server to consolidate all configuration settings
	in one place. Config Server acts as a configuration service API that plugs as just another Configuration
	Provider into standard .NET configuration. Config Server itself reads it config values either out of one of
	the support backing stores, such as Git or Hashicorp Vault. This allows configuration across multiple apps
	and environments to be consolidated into a single location, and provides version control and auditing.
	Config server also support encryption for serving sensitive values such as database connection strings.
